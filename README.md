# MyFalcor

 Falcor starter template based on Falcor 4.4, removing needless components in the [official version](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor), while fixing CHN encoding issues (warning 4819).

There are also some code in the [practice branch](https://github.com/cuteday/MyFalcor/tree/practice) written by me (a graphics newbie), for learning purpose. DXR raytracing is interesting! (≧∇≦)ﾉ
